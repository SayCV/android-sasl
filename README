This is a SASL stack for Android platform, adapted from GNU Classpath source.
Intended for Smack, might prove useful for something else.

As neither java nor javax namespace can be modified, javax.security.sasl has
been moved to gnusasl.javax.security.sasl.

Please note that you have to add
	java.security.Security.addProvider(new gnu.javax.crypto.jce.GnuSasl());
before SASL authentication methods will be active.
